The XZ backdoor refers to a maliciously introduced backdoor found in the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 released in February 2024. This backdoor targeted Debian- and RPM-based systems running on the x86-64 architecture. The backdoor gives an attacker remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system if they possess a specific Ed448 private key. The issue has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

XZ Utils, previously known as LZMA Utils, is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors that include programs like lzma and xz for Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows. The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used for compression/decompression in XZ Utils.

A backdoor is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system. It can be used for securing remote access to a computer, obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems, gaining access to privileged information, corrupting or deleting data, or transferring information within networks. Backdoors can take various forms, such as hidden parts of a program, separate programs, firmware code, or parts of an operating system. Trojan horses can also create vulnerabilities in devices by installing backdoors. Some backdoors are deliberately created for legitimate purposes, such as providing manufacturers with a way to restore user passwords.

In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system called the Clipper chip with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access, but the chip was unsuccessful. Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and using neural networks to detect them.
